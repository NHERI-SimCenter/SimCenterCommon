Creating install packages:

1. build the Release version of the application
2. run the install script from the TInF-Installer folder

   $ sh InstallScripts/makeInstallPackageTInF.sh

3. the install package will be in the build tree

Notes:

* the scripts read the build folder from TurbulentInflowTool.pro.user
