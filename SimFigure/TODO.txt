1) I can select the curves and need to send the respective signal with the proper curve index.

2) unselect needs to recover the original color and line width
    - introduce a select buffer that stores
        (1) pointer to object
        (2) pen settings
        (3) brudh settings
    - a new selection needs to check whether a previously selected object exists (nullptr)
    - if previous object exists, restore pen and brush settings

3) a private map between curve objects (C++-pointers) and plot IDs (MATLAB STYLE)
    - this includes an inverse map for quick identification of selected objects
    +++ done: 05/28/2019

4) some helper functions for changing line width and style for existing curves
   - lineWidth()
   - setLineWidth(int)
   - lineStyle()
   - setLineStyle(LineStyle)
   - lineMarker()
   - setLineMarker(LineStyle)

5) provide a demo app to illustrate all features and show th eprogrammer how to use them
   +++ this is SimPlotDemo.App
   - keep updating as new features become available

6) let user check and change axisStyle (default, logx, logy, loglog)
   +++ done: 05/28/2019

7) add doxygen documentation
