 * HOW TO USE SectionTitle in Qt Creator/Designer          *
 *                                                         *
 * 1) create your section title as QLabel                  *
 * 2) promote this QLabel to SectionTitle                  *
 *                                                         *
 * You me need to create an entry for the promoted widget  *
 * the first time you want to use this technique in your   *
 * Qt Creator/Designer installation.                       *
 *                                                         *
 * Common issues:                                          *
 * make sure the path to the header file is given properly *
 * relative to the main folder.  When using the            *
 * NHERI-SimCenter widgets respository, the proper path is *
 *   ../widgets/Common/sectiontitle.h                      *
 *                                                         *
